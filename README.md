# Overview

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

To grow as a software engineer, I wanted to expand my understanding of statistical programming by learning the R language. This software reads a CSV file that contains data of advertising spending and the outcome in sales. The program then builds a linear regression model and creates a graph showing the relationship between advertising and sales using ggplot2.

The purpose for writing this software is to have a solid foundation of using R's syntax and data structures by applying it to a real world situation. It demonstrates how the R language works with multiple datatypes (numeric, integer, character, logical, and list), dataframes, and loops.

# Future Work

- Add user input to 
- Allow user to modify what is considered "high sales"
- Make graph interactive
